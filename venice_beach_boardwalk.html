              <h2>History</h2>
              <br>
                <p> In 1905, tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney realized his dream of opening "Venice of America", a resort town filled with fun and gondolas that would be remeniscent of Italy's Venice.
                  It included a canal system, miniature railroad, amphitheater, beach and other attractions that would entice tens of thousands of people to flock to his Venice weekly.
                  This included the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Kinney built a small amusement park on the pier of the beach, which would end up burning down twice shortly after his death.
                  Venice was originally known as the "Playground of the Pacific", but eventually became run-down to the point where the City of Los Angeles tore down many of its attractions.
                  In 1977, Venice Beach was recognized as the "Roller Skating Capital of the World" and grew as a popular magnet for tourists once again.

                  <br>
                  <p>Not to be confused with Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, Muscle Beach Venice is an outdoor gym known that has been open since 1963.
                    It is known as the "Home of Bodybuilding" and has cranked out <em>many</em> notable bodybuilders such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno.
                    The gym is open 7 days a week and operates between 8 am to 6 pm Monday though Friday, 8 am to 4 pm on Saturday, and 12 pm - 4 pm on Sunday.
                    There are different memberships if you are interested in becoming a member of the gym (prices can be found <a href="https://www.laparks.org/venice/muscle-beach-venice-outdoor-gym" target="_blank">here</a>).
                    If you are not interested in becoming a gym member, you are welcome to watch the body builders in action since the gym is outdoors.

                  <br>
                  <p> Although it is a newer attraction, with its construction being finished in 2009, the Venice Beach Skate Park stands as one of the sights to go see while visiting the Venice Beach Boardwalk, especially for skateboarding enthusiasts.
                    The Venice Beach Skate Park is a celebration of skateboarding culture that has been present at Venice Beach since at least the 70's, when California was experiencing a severe drought and all surfers had were empty swimming pools to play in.
                    You are welcome to view the skateboarders pull of their gnarly stunts across the park and can even join in if you bring your own skateboard! 
                    It is open daily from 8 am until 7 pm, except on rainy days.
                    There is <strong>no cost</strong> to enter the skatepark.

                  <br>
                  <p> The word 'beach' isn't in the name 'Venice <em>Beach</em> Boardwalk' for no reason, right? 
                      Of course not!
                      The Venice Beach Boardwalk is located on an <em>actual</em> beach!
                      After walking of the boardwalk, you can go dip your toes in the fresh ocean water and take in the relaxing ocean scents and sounds.
                      You can also decide to go surfing, swimming, or just play in the sand. 
                      A bike path is also located on the beach if you decide you wanna rent (or bring your own) bike to ride in the wind next to the tropical palm trees.
                      While there is <em>no cost</em> to enter the beach, you'll probably want some cash if you decide to park nearby.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      P.S. <em>Don't feed the seagulls...</em> Just kidding!
