              <p> About a 35 minutes drive from Downtown Los Angeles (with no traffic), is the iconic Venice Beach Boardwalk (also known as Ocean Walk Front). 
                  The Venice Beach Boardwalk is a slightly over 2 mile walkway filled with shops, restaurants, and the fun and funky vibes of its creative performers.
                  Not only can you see many awesome people showing off their splendiferous talents, the Venice Boardwalk is known for its celebrated attractions such as Muscle Beach and its skatepark. </p>
              <br>
              <h2>History</h2>
              <br>
                <p> In 1905, tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney realized his dream of opening "Venice of America", a resort town filled with fun and gondolas that would be remeniscent of Italy's Venice.
                  It included a canal system, miniature railroad, amphitheater, beach and other attractions that would entice tens of thousands of people to flock to his Venice weekly.
                  This included the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Kinney built a small amusement park on the pier of the beach, which would end up burning down twice shortly after his death.
                  Venice was originally known as the "Playground of the Pacific", but eventually became run-down to the point where the City of Los Angeles tore down many of its attractions.
                  In 1977, Venice Beach was recognized as the "Roller Skating Capital of the World" and grew as a popular magnet for tourists once again.
