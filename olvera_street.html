              <p> In the heart of Downtown Los Angeles, is a little historical gem called Placita Olvera, otherwise known as Olvera Street. It is a popular Mexican American marketplace with important historical significance for Southern California.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>History</h3>
              <br>
                <p> In 1781, Olvera Street was originally founded by several families who were sent from Mexico to Southern California by King Carlos the III of Spain to establish "El Pueblo de Los Angeles" (The Town of the Angels).
                It was originally called Wine (or Vine) Street as it was located near a winery and vineyards. 
                Olvera Street became a host for politics and in 1877 it was renamed as the current Olvera Street in honor of LA County's first judge, Agustin Olvera, who resided there. 
                In 1926, history buff and socialite Christine Sterling came down from Northern California to enjoy the cultural haven she had heard about, but instead was greeted by rundown buildings and street crimes.
                Dissatisfied with the state of Olvera Street and the rumors that the street would be torn down by bulldozers for its run down state, Sterling lead a campaign to preserve the "birthplace of Los Angeles".
                After a successful campaign and funding from many sponsors, Olvera Street was saved. On Easter Sunday in 1930, the establishment of an iconic Mexican American marketplace and cultural gem was made official.

                  Open Wednesday through Sunday between 10 am to 4 pm, the Avila Adobe is a historical building known for its seniority in Los Angeles.
                  In 1818, the Avila Adobe was constructed by ranchero Francisco Jos√© Avila (who served as the mayor of Los Angeles in 1810). 
                  After being rundown by time, it was one of the buildings that was restored and declared as California Historic Landmark #145 in Olvera Street's opening in 1930.
                  It is known as the oldest house in Los Angeles.
