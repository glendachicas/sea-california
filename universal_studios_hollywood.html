              <p>In the depths of the San Fernando Valley lies the world-renowned entertainment amusement park called Universal Studios Hollywood.
                Focusing on the television and movie industry, Universal Studios Hollywood is a <em>must go</em> location to go visit while in Southern California.
                There are events all year round, especially during Fall and Winter, when USH has its Halloween Horror Nights and Grinchmas extravaganza!
                No matter what time of year you visit, there's <em>always</em> something for everyone to do for a full day of fun.
                There's <em>no</em> doubt that you'll definitely feel the magic of the entertainment industry while you are here!
                </p>
              <h2>History</h2>
              <br>
                <p> German-American film producer Carl Laemmle dreamed of making the <em>first</em> city solely dedicated to making films in Southern California (known for its good weather) after he needed more land to create new movies for his movie studio.
                  He invested over 1 million dollars in creating Universal City, which included not only the movie studio itself, but a fire and police station, post office, school, and even a zoo!
                  In 1915, Laemmle went on an 8 day train ride, going from Los Angeles to Chicago, to promote the opening of his brand new city.
                  The opening was a massive success, filled with two days of parades, air shows, and other festivities that unfortunaely ended up in the death of a stunt man during the second day at an air show.
                  Fortunately, that did not stop Laemmle from re-opening the city to guests on movie sets and started offering admission for the public to come see movies being made (they were silent at the time) for only 25 cents.
                  This later evolved into the world-famous studio tour which started in 1915 and cost $2.50 for a 90-minute guided tour, via tram, around the movie studio.
                  The park itself did not open up until 1964, when the studio tours were re-introduced (they had stopped due to movies requiring sound) and the attractions of the park were slowly built around the tram tours.
                  Universal Studios Hollywood continues to thrive and upgrade its attractions often, with the newest attraction, Super Nintendo World, expecting to open up around Spring 2023.

                      Based on the 2015 film "Jurassic World", Jurassic World - The Ride sends you on a 'peaceful' boat tour throughout the Jurassic World facilties.
                      What will you do when the infamous Indomnus Rex comes to say hello? 
                      Run? 
                      <em>You can't.</em> 
                      Scream? 
                      I guess that might help...your nerves.
                      Have fun while exploring the updated dinosaur theme park! It's <em>totally</em> safe. <img src="https://image.pngaaa.com/318/393318-middle.png" height="18px" width="25px" alt="Emoji eyes looking sideways">

                        <p>Based on the post-apocalyptic 1995 movie 'WaterWorld', WaterWorld is a classic show that you should <em>definitely</em> not miss during your stay at Universal Studios Hollywood.
                          The world of WaterWorld is based in the year 2500, when sea levels have risen drastically and have resulted in <em>every continent of Earth</em> being covered in water.
                          What will happen to Helen and the Mariner when the Deacon finds out that Helen has found evidence of dry land. 
                          There are several showtimes during the day that are posted on signs throughout the park as well as on the Universal Studios Hollywood app, so don't worry if you can't make it to the first show.
                          There are 'wet zones' (covered in blue) throughout the arena where the show takes place that you will either want to sit in or avoid, depending on whether or not you feel like getting wet.
                          The WaterWorld show is <em>very</em> interactive, with the Mariner's crew members encouraging audience particpation that everyone is invited to take part in.
                          This show is a <em>must-see</em> for action and WaterWorld fans!

                  <br>
                  <p>The World-Famous Studio Tour was the basic foundation for the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park.
                    Orignally starting in 1915 (<em>without</em> the trams), the studio tour has evolved through several openings, closings, and renovations throughout the years.
                    With an approximately 60 minute run-time, the World-Famous Studio Tour invites you to ride a tram throughout hundreds of acres that consist of the backlot and the places where your favorite Universal/NBC movies and shows were produced.
                    Tours occur in intervals all day long until about sunset. Most tours are in English, but there have been tours guided in other languages like Spanish and Mandarin.
                    Sit down, enjoy the ride, and learn all about how Universal Studios works on this iconic tour!

                    Characters from your favorite movies and television shows, as well as actors playing parts as residents of Universal Studios, can be found all around the park.
                    A full range of characters are on the roster at USH, but you do need to use some effort to see who is hanging out where and at what time.
                    Some beloved characters include Shrek, the Mystery Inc. gang, Curious George, Hello Kitty, Optimus Prime, a velociraptor, Poppy, and many others!
                    Characters can sometimes change their outfit or appear for a limited time depending on the time of year.
                    Sometimes there are shows that include character performances, such as the Tri-Wizard Spirit Rally and the Who-Ville Christmas Tree Lighting (the second is available <em>only</em> during Grinchmas).
                    Go find some characters and take fun pictures to remember your day at Universal Studios Hollywood!
