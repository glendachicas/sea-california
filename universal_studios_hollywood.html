              <p>In the depths of the San Fernando Valley lies the world-renowned entertainment amusement park called Universal Studios Hollywood.
                Focusing on the television and movie industry, Universal Studios Hollywood is a <em>must go</em> location to go visit while in Southern California.
                There are events all year round, especially during Fall and Winter, when USH has its Halloween Horror Nights and Grinchmas extravaganza!
                No matter what time of year you visit, there's <em>always</em> something for everyone to do for a full day of fun.
                There's <em>no</em> doubt that you'll definitely feel the magic of the entertainment industry while you are here!
                </p>
              <h2>History</h2>
              <br>
                <p> German-American film producer Carl Laemmle dreamed of making the <em>first</em> city solely dedicated to making films in Southern California (known for its good weather) after he needed more land to create new movies for his movie studio.
                  He invested over 1 million dollars in creating Universal City, which included not only the movie studio itself, but a fire and police station, post office, school, and even a zoo!
                  In 1915, Laemmle went on an 8 day train ride, going from Los Angeles to Chicago, to promote the opening of his brand new city.
                  The opening was a massive success, filled with two days of parades, air shows, and other festivities that unfortunaely ended up in the death of a stunt man during the second day at an air show.
                  Fortunately, that did not stop Laemmle from re-opening the city to guests on movie sets and started offering admission for the public to come see movies being made (they were silent at the time) for only 25 cents.
                  This later evolved into the world-famous studio tour which started in 1915 and cost $2.50 for a 90-minute guided tour, via tram, around the movie studio.
                  The park itself did not open up until 1964, when the studio tours were re-introduced (they had stopped due to movies requiring sound) and the attractions of the park were slowly built around the tram tours.
                  Universal Studios Hollywood continues to thrive and upgrade its attractions often, with the newest attraction, Super Nintendo World, expecting to open up around Spring 2023.

                          There are 'wet zones' (covered in blue) throughout the arena where the show takes place that you will either want to sit in or avoid, depending on whether or not you feel like getting wet.
                          The WaterWorld show is <em>very</em> interactive, with the Mariner's crew members encouraging audience particpation that everyone is invited to take part in.
