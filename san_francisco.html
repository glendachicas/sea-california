            <h2>History</h2>
            <br>
              <p>
                San Francisco was originally a Spanish mission and pueblo before it was conquered by the United States in 1846. 
                In 1848, San Francisco became the central port of the Gold Rush. The city's population rapidly grew due to the increased migration of “forty-niners”. For a period of time, the city lacked structure causing it to be lawless.
                The 1906 earthquake and fire was a devastating point in San Francisco's history because of the destruction that was caused. Even though the earthquake destroyed most of the city, it did not stop the city from thriving. 
                Today, San Francisco is one of the most popular cities in the world.
